    <h3>Workshop of the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE24)
Montréal, Québec, Canada, September 20th 2024</h3>
    <br> <br>
    <h4>This workshop will explore the importance of quantum open-source contributions to academic and professional education at all levels of quantum computing expertise. Its objectives include analyzing how open-source contributions enhance quantum computing education and evaluating the significance of mentorship programs and other open-source initiatives. The workshop will showcase stories of individuals who have contributed to quantum computing through open-source projects, highlighting their achievements and paths to draw comparisons and insights. Moreover, it aims to determine the main benefits of different open-source quantum initiatives, such as hackathons, tutorials, and talks, as educational resources, while also addressing their current limitations. These include: how to use open-source platforms as a learning tool; how to maximize attendance at QC events; and what it means to be proactive, diverse and inclusive in QC.</h4>

<h1>Target Audience</h1>

<h4>The workshop is designed to accommodate individuals of all backgrounds, including researchers, professionals from academia and industry, as well as those who have experience as mentors in various programs or collaborating on open source projects. Additionally, it is suitable for newcomers to quantum computing, open source enthusiasts, or individuals with experience in quantum computing or programming but no prior knowledge of open source. It is crucial to ensure equitable representation from these diverse groups to accurately reflect their perspectives and opinions in the resulting report. This will facilitate the creation of local or international mentoring opportunities, contributions to open source projects, or the initiation of open source quantum computing projects during the workshop. </h4>
